# App Rating Prediction

## Overview
The App Rating Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the rating of mobile applications. This repository contains the code and resources needed to train and deploy a model that can estimate the rating of an app based on various features and attributes.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of a large collection of mobile applications, including their corresponding features such as app size, number of downloads, user reviews, and more. The dataset has been preprocessed and is included in the repository for convenience. 

## Model
The prediction model is built using machine learning techniques, specifically employing a supervised learning approach. The code includes data preprocessing steps, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The chosen algorithm for this project is a regression model, which is trained to predict the continuous rating value.

## Dependencies
To run the code and reproduce the results, the following dependencies are required:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

Please refer to the `requirements.txt` file for the specific versions of the dependencies used during development.

## Usage
To use the App Rating Prediction model, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Prepare your dataset by following the provided data preprocessing steps or by providing your own preprocessed dataset.
4. Train the model by executing the training script.
5. Evaluate the trained model's performance on the test set.
6. To predict the rating for a new app, use the provided inference script and provide the necessary input features.
